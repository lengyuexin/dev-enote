**避免空洞的单词和词组**

* 一些空洞的单词或词组根本不能为句子带来任何相关的或重要的信息，完全可以被删掉。
* When all things are considered,young adults of today live more satisfying lives than those of their parents, in my opinion。
* 这句话当中的“when all things are considered”和“in my opinion”都显得多余。完全可以去掉。　　

**避免重复**　
* 尽量避免重复使用同样的词汇
* The farm my grandfather grew up on was large in size。
* large对一个farm来说就是size方面的large，所以in size可以去掉，改为： The farm my grandfather grew up on was large。　
* 更简洁的表达方式为：　My grandfather grew up on a large farm。

**选择最恰当的语法结构**　　
　
* 选择合适的语法结构可以使句子意思的表达更为精确和简练
* 一个句子的主语和谓语动词应该能够反映句子中的最重要的意思
* The situation that resulted in my grandfather's not being able tostudy engineering was that his father needed help on the farm.
*上面这句话需要表达的重要的概念是“grandfather's not being able tostudy”，原句主语是situation，谓语动词是was，不能强调需要表达的重点概念
* 可改为:　My grandfather couldn't study engineering because his father needed help on the farm。
* 避免频繁使用“there be”结构
* There were 25 cows on the farm that my grandfather had to milk every day. It was hard work for my grandfather
* 更简洁的句式为:My grandfather worked hard milking 25 cowsdaily。
