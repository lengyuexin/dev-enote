### 基本结构


> 从过去开始一直延续到现在的时间段,结构为have/has+done

**区分have been to/have gone to/ have been in**

||||
|--|--|--|
|结构|含义|例句|
| have been to  |去又回,强调往返| I have been to America.(我去过美国)|
|have gone to|去,强调去这个动作,也许还在路上|I have gone to America.(我去美国了)|
|have been in|一直停留| I have been in America for 2 years.(我在美国待两年了)|

### 特点

* 现在完成时和一般过去时很像，都指的是发生过的事。
* 现在完成时强调完成，对之后有影响
* 一般过去时只是简单的叙述。
* 常常和[已经],[还],[刚刚]等词语连用(already,yet,just)
* 对时间段的提问用how long (since),回答用for或since.
* 动词要用可延续性谓语动词或系动词
* 使用when提问的多是时间点,一般过去时

**示例**

* 我吃完饭了              --纯叙述
* 我已经吃完饭了          -- 你们吃吧


* 我看了一部电影          --纯叙述
* 我已经看过这部电影了    -- 不想看第二遍，能不能换一个？


* 我没起床              --纯叙述
* 我还没起床            --等我起床后再出去玩







### 不可延续动词的转换


|||
|--|--|
| 原型|系动词或可延续性动词|
|come/arrive|be here|
|come back|be back|
|go /leave|be away(from)|
|go out|be out|
|begin/start|be on|
|finish|be over|
|die|be dead|
|wake up|be up/awake|
|join|be in|
|put on|be on|
|open|be open|
|close|be closed|

**动词划分**

* 动词分为谓语动词和系动词两大类
* 谓语动词分为可延续性和不可延续性两类
* 系动词包含be动词和其他系动词(如感官系动词)

### 不可转换的非延续性动词

> 并不是所有的非延续性动词都可以转换,不可转换的(如find,eat,tell,fire),提问多久时使用如下结构

  **How long has it been since(接一个完整的句子,时态为一般过去时)**

  * 可转换的非延续性动词,也可用这种结构
