## 陈述句--长句构成

> 对于一个简单句而言，在保证句子结构完整的情况下，如果要想使句子变长，只能加定语，状语和同位语。


 * 副词和介词短语既能当定语用又能当状语用，关键看翻译顺序
 * 定语放在名词前翻译,状语放在动词前翻译
 * 原句: a boy bought a car

1. 加入定语: A young boy at school bought his first  second-hand sports car.
  
2. 加入定语和状语:A young boy at school excitedly bought his first  second-hand sports car  with his parents  in the afternoon  last week at 4s shop with quite a lot of money.


 ### 副词/介词短语

 **副词**

 * 副词做状语时:可前，可后，可中(在时表词前后，一般放后)
 * 作定语时放在所修饰的名词之后
 * 一句话加上或去掉副词结构不变

---


**介词短语**

* 介词短语由介词+宾语构成
* 做状语可前可后
* 做后置定语


**例句:(一般现在时和一般过去时会有特殊性)**

1. He even didn't tell me. <=> He didn't even tell me.(这个更常用)
2. He really is a teacher. <=> He is really a teacher.(这个更常用)
3. He clearly knows it. 这里只能放时表词前，does+know=knows
4. He quickly got into the room. 这里只能放时表词前，did+get=got
