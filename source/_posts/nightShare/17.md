* Ah, come on! Help! Help us! Help us! Help us! Huh?
* I was planning on saving that for when the time was right.
* Dave, I am so confused. Why are you doing this?
* Don’t you and Karla want to escape and go back home?
* Karla can’t know there’s a way off this island.
* It’s the only way I can win her heart. And soon, she will see.
* She will be as madly in love with me as I am with her.
* And if that means staying on this island forever, then so be it.

**注解**
1. as…as 使用时要注意第一个as为副词，第二个as为连词。 其基本结构为：as+ adj./ adv. +as。
2. So be it. 意思是：那就这样吧。
