> 自由的鸟是困不住的，狱友由衷为安迪的新生感到高兴。

* Sometimes it makes me sad, though,Andy being gone. 
* I have to remind myself that some birds aren’t meant to be caged. 
* Their feathers are just too bright.
* And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. 
* But still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they’re gone. 
* I guess I just miss my friend.
