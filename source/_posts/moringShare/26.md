> There 在英语中很常用，常常会组成there be的句型，表示“有”。

* There are so many people in the supermarket.  超市里有好多人啊

* There is nobody in the street. 街上没有人

* I have been there. 常常表示“我去过那儿，到过某个地方”，可能是一次，可能是好几次。

* Beijing is a beautiful city and I have been there three times. 北京是个美丽的城市，我去过那儿三次了。

>然而，在口语中，“I have been there”可不一定是“我去过那儿”！啥意思呢？

* I have been there means I have also done or experienced whatever is being discussed.

* 表示我也有过那样的经历，我能体会到那种困难（常常用于理解对方的感受和遭遇）。
