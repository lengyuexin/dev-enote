 >It tells the story of Simba , a lion cub，who flees the family home when his dad– King Mufasa–snuff it and wicked Uncle Scar tricks him into thinking it was his fault. He grows up in a jungle hiding place, alongside newfound buddies Timon and Pumbaa (a meerkat and a warthog, in case you're wondering)，before eventually plucking up the courage to return to the Pride Land and take back what is rightfully his.
